Lesson 1: What is React?

blahblahblah
You'll see a lot of "skipped" tests. Those will be important in later
lessons. For now, focus on the tests that are passing or failing.

When all your (non-skipped) tests are passing, start lesson 2 with
"yarn lesson2"!

To see these instructions again, run "yarn lesson1:instr".
To see run just the tests, run "yarn lesson1:test" instead.
To do both, use "yarn lesson1".
